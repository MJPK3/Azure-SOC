# Building a SOC and a Honeynet in Azure (Cyber Attacks in Real Time)

## Introduction

The objective of this project was to create a mini honeynet by deploying multiple vulnerable virtual machines in Azure in order to attract and analyze cyber attacks. 
Azure was configured to ingest log sources from various resources into the Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was deployed to develop attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents based on the collected data.

In the initial phase of the project, I observed a set of security metrics for 24 hours within the insecure environment. This provided a baseline for comparison after implementing security hardening measures. 

After addressing the incidents and identifying vulnerabilities, I hardened the environment by applying security controls. In this newly hardened environment, I observed the same security metrics for another 24 hours and compared the results with the initial baseline.

The metrics I tracked are as follows:

- SecurityEvent (Windows Event Logs)
- Syslog (Linux Event Logs)
- SecurityAlert (Log Analytics Alerts Triggered)
- SecurityIncident (Incidents created by Sentinel)
- AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL (Malicious Flows allowed into our honeynet)


The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure include the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel


## Architecture Before Hardening / Security Controls

Prior to hardening, all resources were originally deployed and exposed to the Internet. Both the  Network Security Groups and the firewalls of the virtual machines were wide open and all other resources were deployed with their public endpoints visible to the Internet


## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

After implementing hardening and security controls, the Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking all traffic unless it came from the admin workstation. All the other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as a Private Endpoint

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

This attack map displays the number of incidents generated by leaving the Network Security Group (NSG) open:

This attack map displays the incidents for syslog authentication failures experienced by the Linux server:

This attack map displays RDP and SMB failures against the Window machine:

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:
Start Time 2023-12-23 10:22 PM
Stop Time 2023-12-24 10:22 PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 12354
| Syslog                   | 941
| SecurityAlert            | 3
| SecurityIncident         | 123
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 2421

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:
Start Time 2023-12-27 3:15 PM
Stop Time	2023-12-28  3:15 PM

| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 8530
| Syslog                   | 1
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In conclusion, a mini honeynet was created in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was utilized to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Metrics were measured in the insecure environment (before applying security controls), and then measured again after implementing security controls. The significant decrease in security events and incidents after applying the security controls highlights their effectiveness in safeguarding the environment.

It should be noted, however, that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, a higher incidence of security alerts and events would have likely been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
